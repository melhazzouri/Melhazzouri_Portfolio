# Project 1: DL Chatbot- DoorDash Customer Support: Project Overview
In the past few years, chatbots have become wildly popular in the tech and business sectors. These intelligent bots are so adept at imitating natural human languages and conversing with humans, that companies across various industrial sectors are adopting them. From e-commerce firms to healthcare institutions, everyone seems to be leveraging this nifty tool to drive business benefits. In this project, a Customer Support Chatbot was built and deployed. The Artificial Intelligent Chatbot was trained using Deep Learning algorithms and deployed using the Flask method.

# Project 2: French To English Translation: Project Overview
Within the European Union, French holds the distinction of being the fourth most widely spoken mother tongue, and depending on who you ask, it may even be the second most prevalent.A staggering 80 million individuals worldwide claim French as their first language, with 61 million of them residing in France. French-speaking communities can be found dispersed throughout various regions of the world.

Despite the language's global popularity as the "language of love," it remains challenging for many individuals to acquire French fluency. This is a hurdle that I, too, have encountered, having recently relocated to Montreal, Quebec.  I am using this project to build a Neural Machine Translation model to translate from French to English.

# Project 4: Sentiment Analysis Using LSTM
RNNs have been applied with success to many kinds of natural language processing projects in the past few years. Those applications include speech recognition, language modeling, translation, and, of course, sentiment analysis. None of this would be possible without a special kind of RNN, and that is the LSTM (Long short-term memory). For many purposes, LSTMs work better than traditional recurrent networks.LSTM models are widely used nowadays, as they are particularly designed to have a long-term “memory” that is capable of understanding the overall context better than other neural networks affected by the long-term dependency problem. In this project, LSTM was used to carry out sentiment analysis over a set of Amazon reviews.

# Project 4: Amazon Reviews Sentiment Analysis
Sentiment Analysis is a prevalent method of text classification that assesses an incoming message and determines whether the sentiment expressed is positive, negative, or neutral. In today's world, where customers are more vocal about their thoughts and emotions, it is crucial for businesses to have a grasp on these sentiments. It can be challenging for a person to manually examine each statement and determine the underlying emotion. However, with the advancement of technology, companies are now able to automatically analyze customer feedback, be it from surveys or social media interactions, to gain insights into their customers' needs and preferences. This allows them to tailor their products and services accordingly. In this project, sentiment analysis was carried out over a set of Amazon reviews. SpaCy was used for tokenization, Lemmatization and Removing stopwords and scikit-learn to build the machine learning models for different batches of data: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree,  K-Nearest Neighbors Algorithm (KNN), Support Vector Classifier (SVC) and Naive Bayes.

# Project 5:  NLP - Amazon Reviews Clustering: Project Overview
Amazon is the largest E-commerce platform in the world. And, customer reviews are proven sales drivers, and something the majority of customers will definitely want to see before deciding to make a purchase. In this project, an NLP technique has been used to process a set of Amazon reviews, given by customers. Customer reviews were scrapped using BeautifulSoup. An NLP technique was used to process the reviews. The text has been preprocessed by removing numbers, punctuation, emojis, urls, and stopwords. The resulting text has been represented with Tf-Idf vectorization. The vector representation of the text has been used to perform text clustering. Clusters built with K Means algorithm, optimal number of clusters were found using the Elbow method, extraction of clusters topics through cluster centroids coordinates and visualization. It was possible to identify 5 different clusters that describe the segmentation of the customer reviews.
