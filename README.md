# Project 1: DL Chatbot- DoorDash Customer Support: Project Overview
In the past few years, chatbots have become wildly popular in the tech and business sectors. These intelligent bots are so adept at imitating natural human languages and conversing with humans, that companies across various industrial sectors are adopting them. From e-commerce firms to healthcare institutions, everyone seems to be leveraging this nifty tool to drive business benefits. In this project, a Customer Support Chatbot was built and deployed. The Artificial Intelligent Chatbot was trained using Deep Learning algorithms and deployed using the Flask method.

# Project 2: French To English Translation: Project Overview
Within the European Union, French holds the distinction of being the fourth most widely spoken mother tongue, and depending on who you ask, it may even be the second most prevalent.A staggering 80 million individuals worldwide claim French as their first language, with 61 million of them residing in France. French-speaking communities can be found dispersed throughout various regions of the world.

Despite the language's global popularity as the "language of love," it remains challenging for many individuals to acquire French fluency. This is a hurdle that I, too, have encountered, having recently relocated to Montreal, Quebec.  I am using this project to build a Neural Machine Translation model to translate from French to English.
